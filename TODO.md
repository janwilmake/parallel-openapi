Goal: making an improved OpenAPI that is more agent-friendly to be browsed, then making this a repo with better context.

TODO:

- package: `llms-txt-to-readme` to also add links. Separate since im not sure this is what they want.
- I need to use uithub with this one, but getting 403: https://github.com/shapleyai/parallel-sdk-internal-typescript, as well at https://uuithub.com/shapleyai/parallel-sdk-internal-typescript
- Add `externalDocs` to every endpoint using direct url to .md on mintlify docs
