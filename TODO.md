Goal: making an improved OpenAPI that is more agent-friendly to be browsed, then making this a repo with better context.

Prompt used:
https://letmeprompt.com/rules-httpsuithu-3bvkpn0

TODO:

- use oapis.org as cli instead and add that as script
- generate separate file per tag
- generate separate file per operation
- Generate README that's an llms.txt showing each operation
- CLI: add ability to fetch in the external docs url

Worth a post, great way to introduce parallel to my audience.
